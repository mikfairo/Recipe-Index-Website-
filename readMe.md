SBA 307: HTML and CSS 
Created a recipe index website with a nav bar with three internal HTML pages (Home,Recipes and Login). Nav bar/Recipes has a dropdown with no accessible links (due to time limitations). The home page contains some styling with a hover rotate animation on the photo. Recipes page includes a 3x3 table with different dishes in each cell, there was suppose to be a hover text overlay implemented but I couldn't figure out how to adjust for each cell and have it align. Login page includes a form with user input field of Username and Password as well as a Gif. Looking back at this SBA I wish I prioritized time management, requirements to be met, and simplicity. I was trying to do too much in a short period and over-estimated what I wanted design-wise.
